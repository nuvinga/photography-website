					 It is the stage where you'd be narrowing down production choices. That is where all the preparation takes place before the camera 
					 rolls and the overall project vision is set. Pre-production involves also figuring out the location and casting of the film. Then the 
					 director must employ a Line Manager or Production Manager to build the film schedule and budget.

					 footage and compiling the film. Visual effects (VFX), music and sound design contributions are provided as needed. The picture is now 
					 blocked and distribution elements are created.

					 such as Amazon Prime, Netflix and HBO etc.
