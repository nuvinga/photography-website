                <h2>The humble beginning..</h2>
                <p>In 1891, the Edison Company in USA created a prototype of the Kinetoscope (a machine that runs a film and
                    projects it to a screen through a bring white light), allowing a single person to to view moving
                    pictures at a time. In 1895, the Lumier Brothers took up the challenge to present projected moving
                    pictures to an paying audience. This made a revelation in the history of cinematography, significantly
                    marking the first theater show.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first films were very short. Mostly, at maximum lasted for no more than a few minutes.
                    They were screened at opera halls, fairgrounds and any other place where darkening the room possible,
                    and was treated as a luxury at the time. Only the people of the highest class and important officials
                    went for cinemas.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    The films were also always accompanied by musicians and choirs to provide live music to the action
                    happening in the film. In few places, lecturers can also be seen to explain to the audience the scene
                    happening. It is described that films after all were not silent as it is nowadays.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Rise of the film industry..</h2>
                <p>
                    Following the great success of film premiers in the USA, counties like Russia, Europe, Scandinavia
                    became interested in the film industry and several national film industries were formed. Gradually,
                    films became longer, narrative, storytelling and catering more flavor to people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the films became more beautiful as it served more people, more people visited the films and paid
                    more for them. The industry grew rapidly and the wealthy was ready to invest in their production.
                    Thus, large studios and centers, especially built for cinemas were built at massive rates. However,
                    Europe had a decline with the First World War seeing fire, however the American industry grew rapidly
                    and steadily.

                <br>
                <br>
                <h2>New avenues sound and color</h2>
                <p>
                    In attempts to add sound to films, firstly phonographic cylinders and discs were used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, Warner Brothers’ came up with a new technique, the Vitaphone System, which used a separate record
                    disc with each reel of film for the sound/ audio. The first film to have incorporated synchronized
                    dialogue was The Jazz Singer (USA, 1927) which was first showcased at the Warner Brothers’ film hall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Later as films improved, people were able to even ride cars into the cinemas. But cinemas had one thing
                    that lacked and was prominent. Color images. Even though color photos were available at the time, film
                    creators did not know to synchronize two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Into the early 1930s, almost all films were synchronized with a full sound system, thanks to Warner
                    Brothers’ Vitaphone System. By the mid-1930s, the world first was films with color and sound both
                    together, and marked the rise to the “Golden Age of Hollywood”.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Digitization of Cinema..</h2>
                <p>
                    Later, after various ups and downs, and frequent threats from the Television industry, the film industry
                    still stayed in its place, with no shake around. Then came a newer chance for cinematography to shine
                    again. Digital cinema would allow cinemas to be much more cost effective and efficient. This would
                    allow the whole film to be also carried around in digital storage devices such as a hard disk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a turning point for the whole film industry. This was the only way for cinemas to catch up
                    with the digitization of the world, along with television technologies. Sony Company was the first to
                    come up with the concept of electronic cinematography, utilizing Sony’s HDVS Professional Digital video
                    cameras, which came inbuilt with analogue to digital converters so the each capture is converted to
                    digital real time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Last Broadcast, aired in 1998 is believed to be the first feature length video shot and edited
                    entirely on consumer-level digital camera equipment. In 1999, George Lucas challenged a supremacy in
                    movie making for the first time by including footage with high definition digital cameras in
                    Star Wars: Episode 1.
