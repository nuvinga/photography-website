			<h3>Dolly Zoom</h3>
			<p id="sinfo"><!--font size and alignment for the text which gives the info-->
			The effect is achieved by zooming a zoom lens to adjust the angle of view (often referred to as field of view, or FOV) while the camera dollies (moves) toward or away from the subject in such a way as to keep the subject the same size in the frame throughout.<br/>
			In its classic form, the camera angle is pulled away from a subject while the lens zooms in, or vice versa.

			<h3>Dutch Angle</h3>
			<p id="sinfo">
			The Dutch angle, also known as Dutch tilt, canted angle, or oblique angle, is a type of camera shot which involves setting the camera at an angle on its roll axis so that the shot is composed with vertical lines at an angle to the side of the frame,<br/>
			or so that the horizon line of the shot is not parallel with the bottom of the camera frame

			<h3>Trunkshot</h3>
			<p id="sinfo"><!--font size and alignment for the text which gives the info-->
			The trunk shot is a cinematic camera angle which captures film from inside the trunk of a car. Though the trunk shot can be produced by placing the camera inside the trunk, the considerable bulk of a conventional movie camera and camera operator makes this difficult.<br/>
			Therefore, the shot is usually "cheated" by having the art department place a trunk door and some of the trunk frame close enough to the camera to make it appear to be shot from within a car. The trunk shot is a specialized type of low-angle shot
